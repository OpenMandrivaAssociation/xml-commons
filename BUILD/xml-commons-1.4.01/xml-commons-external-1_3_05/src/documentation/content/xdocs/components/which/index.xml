        Which is a simple environment checking utility that focuses on reporting the versions of 
        various XML interfaces and some common Apache projects.
      </p>
      <p>Currently, most of the documentation about Which is in it's Javadoc, which you can 
      build via <code>build docs</code>.</p>
      <fixme author="curcuru">Still need to write overview and user guide docs, as well 
      as guidelines for creating WhichProject implementations and best practices about 
      how to use Which for customer support or automated tools.
