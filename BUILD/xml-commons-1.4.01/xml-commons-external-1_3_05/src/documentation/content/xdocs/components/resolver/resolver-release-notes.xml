<para>This document offers a brief summary of what has changed in the
<ulink url="http://xml.apache.org/commons/">Apache XML Commons Resolver</ulink>
package since the 1.0 release.
</para>

<section>
<title>The <classname>CatalogManager</classname> Is No Longer Static</title>

<para>The most pervasive change is that the <classname>CatalogManager</classname>
class is no longer static. It's now possible to instantiate several catalog
managers and each manager can manage several catalogs.</para>

<para>There is still a single static instance of the
<classname>CatalogManager</classname>, available via
<methodname>getStaticManager()</methodname>. This is used by default
if no other catalog manager is instantiated and used. It behaves as
the old static one used to.</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>System Catalogs Are Always Loaded</title>

<para>In the previous version, the system catalogs were not loaded if
a private catalog was requested. That has changed; the system catalogs are now
always loaded.</para>

<para>If you want to avoid loading any system catalogs, establish your own
<classname>CatalogManager</classname> and use the
<methodname>setCatalogsFiles()</methodname> method to assure that no system
catalogs are available.</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Tests/Examples Available</title>

<para>There are several tests in the <filename>tests/resolver</filename> directory
that demonstrate how different instantiations can be used.</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Bootstrap resolver for loading catalog files</title>
<para>The resolver now includes catalog.{dtd,rng,xsd} and uses a "bootstrap"
resolver when it is loading catalog files. This avoids the Catch-22 of
having to resolve this before the resolver is in action ...
